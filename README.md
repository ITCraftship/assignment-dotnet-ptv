# Description

Create an application where the user can enter the state of their assets portfolio on a particular day in the past and see how much money would it be worth today.
The only class of assets we’re considering here are stocks and/or mutual funds.

Example: 
- Start Date: 2013-03-20 
- Initial Balance: $32500 
- Portfolio Allocation: AAPL: 20% GOOG: 50% VTI: 30% 

Please make a simple app where the user can enter this data and can get the results. 

Feel free to visualize the output as you see fit (for example you can present the result using charts to show Aggregate portfolio returns or Portfolio Allocation evolution over time, etc).

# Notes
- https://marketstack.com/ has a free plan. Create your own account to get a key.
- We’ll focus on your C# backend skills, so keep the visualization very simple (it can be a web app, WPF app, or other technology you feel most comfortable with).
- Document any assumptions you’ve made in the Readme file, especially any questions you’d like to ask the domain experts if you had a chance.
- Show us how would you test this code to ensure it's correct.
- Focus on showing us the few key programming and design practices you’re following in your daily work. You can highlight them explicitly in the Readme file to help us with the evaluation.
- We suggest you spend about 2 hours on this task (4 hours as a maximum). **We’d need honest feedback from you to ensure that this is a realistic expectation** (as this is a new interview task for us), so please, share with us how much time you actually spent on this. It won’t negatively impact your assessment in any way.
- We assume that the task is impossible to complete in the given time frame, but we’re not looking for the perfect solution. We’d like to see how you approach solving problems in a new project and domain, what questions you’d ask business experts, what design decisions and tradeoffs you make at the beginning of the project, etc. 
- To show us how you’d take this further – please add a short note to the Readme to describe what you would add/change if you had more time.
- In the Readme file provide instructions allowing the reviewer to run the project easily.
